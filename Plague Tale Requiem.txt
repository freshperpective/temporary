A Plague Tale: Requiem - The Sequel to a Stealth Action Masterpiece

Released on October 18, 2022, A Plague Tale: Requiem is the sequel to the critically acclaimed 2019 game A Plague Tale: Innocence. Developed by Asobo Studio and published by Focus Home Interactive, the game is available on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, Windows, and Xbox Series X/S.

A Plague Tale: Innocence is a game that has captured the attention of players for its unique setting, compelling story, and tense gameplay. Set in medieval France, the game tells the story of Amicia, a young girl who must protect her younger brother Hugo from the Inquisition and swarms of ravenous rats that have been unleashed by a mysterious plague. Along the way, players are taken on a journey through towns, villages, and even an island that have been ravaged by the rats and macular.

Set six months after the events of Innocence, Requiem follows siblings Amicia and Hugo de Rune as they search for a cure to Hugo's blood disease. Fleeing from soldiers of the Inquisition and hordes of rats spreading the black plague, the duo must travel through Southern France to reach the island of La Cuna, which Hugo dreams about.

The destruction shown in the game is both awe-inspiring and horrifying. Players will encounter entire towns and villages that have been overrun by rats, with buildings and homes destroyed and bodies littering the streets. The rats themselves are a terrifying sight, swarming in vast numbers and devouring anything in their path. As players progress through the game, they will also witness the effects of the macular, a mysterious illness that has swept across the land, leaving death and destruction in its wake.

Like its predecessor, Requiem is an action-adventure stealth game played from a third-person perspective. The combat system is significantly expanded, with Amicia equipped with a knife, a sling for throwing rocks, and a crossbow that can easily defeat armoured opponents. Alchemical mixtures can be combined with crossbow bolts, throwing pots, and rocks. The game also introduces tar, which can be used to ignite enemies and increase the radius of the light source.

Requiem's locations are larger, offering players additional options to progress. Stealth is also expanded, with Amicia not dying after being hit once by enemies. She can return to stealth after being discovered, and counter-attack enemies who get too close. Hugo can use an ability named "Echo" to reveal the locations of enemies through walls and control the hordes of rats to overwhelm enemies.

One of the key themes of the game is family and the responsibility that comes with it. Amicia is forced to take on a role she never asked for, becoming her brother's protector and caregiver. Throughout the game, players will see her struggle with the weight of this responsibility, as well as the loss of loved ones along the way. The bond between Amicia and Hugo is central to the game's narrative, and players will feel invested in their journey as they navigate the dangers that lie ahead.

The rats play a huge role in the game, with Amicia and Hugo required to stay in the light or be devoured by them. However, Amicia can manipulate the rats to solve puzzles or lure them to kill enemies. The game also features a progression system where players can unlock additional skills and abilities.

Despite the strengths of the game, some players have criticized the sometimes sluggish movements of Amicia, especially in combat encounters. While the game's focus is on stealth and evasion rather than outright combat, there are times when players must engage in direct confrontations with enemies. During these encounters, Amicia's movements can feel slow and unwieldy, leading to frustration and difficulty in completing these sections of the game.

Requiem's story is full of twists and turns, and the game's developers have done an excellent job of weaving gameplay mechanics into the narrative. The game also features gorgeous graphics and a hauntingly beautiful soundtrack that perfectly captures the game's dark and eerie atmosphere.

Overall, A Plague Tale: Innocence is a game that offers a unique and engaging experience. From its stunning visuals to its compelling story and themes, the game has something to offer players who are looking for a more thoughtful and atmospheric gaming experience. While there are some issues with the game's combat mechanics, these are overshadowed by the strength of its narrative and world-building. For those looking for a game that is both challenging and emotionally resonant, A Plague Tale: Innocence is well worth a look.
