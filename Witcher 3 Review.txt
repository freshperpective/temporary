My Version:

	Witcher 3 Wild Hunt Next gen Review. The game is still the old wine you remember just aged much more. For the new players and the ones who have come from the Netflix series. The first experience of this game is going to be terrific. For the returning players it's more or less the same with a fresh coat of Ray Traced paints. Though there are new armors, Gwent cards and even a few new quests added to the midst. And more hidden things are being discovered.


	This time, the  textures are more crisper, more sharper. They are still not like in the games we've come to expect in 2022 but for an RPG 7+ years older this is a huge thing. And it's free to boot. The monster look more hideous and dangerous. The people even more helpless and dreadful. And the close up cameras in Exploration and Horseback just gets you more immersed while living in this world. 

	I didn't took up to the close up camera in combat though. It was too finicky and tough to play in. Specially when you are surrounded by more than two monsters or bandits. They just love to come at you from behind and out of camera range. It was a little frustrating so I turned it off for combats and I suggest you to do the same. 

	Speaking of Combat, it has been significantly tweaked from the one you know. Several abilities have been nerfed or enhanced. Like the skills that took five points to fully upgrade can now be maxed in just three freeing your hard earned ability points and enabling more combat builds possible. The food doesn't generate health fast enough this time around. And several decotions and blade oils have been tweaked. There are numerous of these changes to list in this short review. BUt when you play it you notice definitely. 
	
	For other thing the close up perspective works very well specially for Roach, your mare. Bonus points-- You can pet and brush her now. Withcer 3 is still, No! Even more beautiful than ever. The sunsets and sunrise in the game are still the best I've seen in any game period. And That holds true till this date. I'm not going to say what has already been said about this games for years and years by journalists and gamers. If you still need a proof that this game is one which you shouldn't miss, just check the number of awards and steam ratings this game has and many more for the next gen. Heck, I even recommend this game to ones who don't even play RPGs or any game. It just that good. Cause it's not just a game it's an art form. And if that still hasn't convinced you yet. Well there's still Gwent. The in house, card game in a RPG game that is till as silly and awesome as before. And with the next gen you now get an additional Roach card. Though I hardly used the thing. Nothing against you Roach but your card is just so weak.  

	Enough of the Positives there are some negatives here as well. The performance of the game is atrocious. The Witcher 3 Next Gen is a 7 year old painting that turns into a wreckage when RT settings are on. Before the 4.0 update the game ran like butter. The previous Game of the year edition of witcher was an well oiled machine. Sure it still had Roach appear on the rooftops, and the armorer guy said 'Top notch swords' for some reason but the perfomance and gameplay was smooth. I don't why but after the next gen update the game just runs stutteringly slow. Specially when you turn on the Ray Tracing on PCs. The frames went from 90+ to barely touching twenties. Often it would just Outright Crash when turning them on. Even the latest GPU and the drivers which ran Cyberpunk in it's full glory can only make the game take a walk. I believe something is amiss here. Players have deduced something wrong with the DX12 integration. But we still aren't sure at the time of writing this article. CDPR has told that they are aware of the issues on the PC. And if you are like me then wait for a hotfix or some workaround because you'll taste stuttering sourness from time to time for now. It may already have been fixed depending on the time this article goes up. The shadows currently look paler without the Ray Tracing as they have removed the HBAO setting as well. 

	Other than that, most of the minor bugs the game had have been fixed or reworked. If you were working with mods before you should check out the list of compatible mods CDPR put out. Most of the ones dealing with the script alteration are broken now. But the ones which alter the visuals and looks may still work. Besides more and more are being updated and released for the next gen. Still you should look at the list before applying them just to make sure. 

	Overall, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is a timeless classic that only gets better with age. The stunning visuals and engaging gameplay make it a must-play for fans of the series and newcomers alike.The game is a true masterpiece, and the next-gen version only adds to its beauty and immersion. We'll be playing the game for a while longer, so expect more in the future. So you too go on and haggle for more coins, fellow Witchers!

Version 1:

Welcome to our review of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt on next-gen consoles! For those of you who are new to the game, be prepared for a thrilling adventure in a stunningly beautiful world. And for those of you who have already played the game, get ready to experience it like never before with improved graphics and textures that make the game look more stunning than ever.

One of the standout features of the next-gen version of the game is the use of ray tracing technology, which adds a new level of realism to the game's visuals. The monsters look more terrifying, the people more helpless, and the world more immersive than ever before.

One aspect of the game that we didn't particularly enjoy, however, was the close-up camera during combat. While it added to the immersion in exploration and horseback riding, it made combat situations more frustrating, as enemies would often attack from out of camera range. We ended up turning this feature off and recommend that you do the same.

Aside from this minor issue, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt remains an absolutely stunning game that is well worth experiencing. The sunsets and sunrises are still some of the most beautiful we've seen in any game, and the in-game card game, Gwent, is just as silly and fun as ever.

If you're still on the fence about whether or not to play this game, just take a look at the numerous awards and high Steam ratings it has received. We even recommend it to non-gamers because it's just that good. So give it a try, and let us know what you think in the comments below!

Version 2:

Welcome to our review of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt on next-gen consoles! We've been eagerly anticipating this update, and we're happy to say that it does not disappoint. The game is still the old wine you remember, just aged and refined with a fresh coat of ray tracing paints. The textures are more crisp and sharp, and the monsters look more hideous and dangerous than ever before.

One thing we didn't love was the close-up camera during combat, as it was too finicky and tough to play with. Specially when you are surrounded by more than two monsters or bandits, they just love to come at you from behind and out of camera angles. It was a little frustrating, so we turned it off for combats and recommend that you do the same. However, the close-up perspective works very well for exploration and horseback riding, and it really helps to immerse you in the world of The Witcher.

Aside from this minor issue, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt remains an absolutely stunning game that is well worth experiencing. The sunsets and sunrises are still some of the best we've seen in any game, and the in-game card game, Gwent, is just as silly and fun as ever. The addition of a new Roach card for the next-gen version is a nice touch, even if we didn't find it particularly useful in gameplay.

We did encounter some performance issues on our PC, with frame rates dropping significantly when we turned on the ray tracing. CDPR has acknowledged these issues and is working on a fix, but it may not be available yet depending on when you're watching this video. If you're experiencing similar issues, we recommend checking for updates and making sure you have the latest GPU drivers installed.

Overall, we're thrilled with the next-gen update to The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, and we can't wait to continue exploring this incredible world. The game is a true masterpiece, and the next-gen version only adds to its beauty and immersion. We'll be playing the game for a while longer, so expect more videos in the future. Until then, happy gaming, and may the winds be at your back!


Version 3:

The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt has received a next-gen update, making its already stunning world even more beautiful with sharper textures and ray tracing. The added level of detail can be seen in every aspect of the game, from the menacing monsters that roam the land to the helpless villagers caught in the crossfire. The game's close-up cameras during exploration and horseback riding make for a more immersive experience, allowing players to fully take in the sights and sounds of the world.

Combat in The Witcher 3 can be intense, and the next-gen update introduces a new combat camera that allows players to get up close and personal with the action. While this can add to the excitement of battle, it can also be frustrating as enemies can attack from out of frame, making it difficult to defend yourself. If this becomes too much of a hindrance, players can switch back to the original combat camera for a more traditional perspective.

The next-gen update also includes additional quests and content for players to enjoy. One of the standout additions is the new Roach card for the in-house card game, Gwent. While this may not seem like much, Gwent fans will appreciate the added challenge and strategy that the new card brings to the game.

Despite the improvements and additions, the performance of the game on PC has reportedly been poor, with frame rates dropping significantly when ray tracing is enabled. CD Projekt Red is aware of the issue and working on a fix, but for now, players may need to lower their graphics settings or wait for a patch to improve the game's performance.

Overall, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is a timeless classic that only gets better with age. The stunning visuals and engaging gameplay make it a must-play for fans of the series and newcomers alike. However, be sure to check the list of compatible mods before using any, as many script-altering mods are no longer functional. Happy hunting, witchers!
